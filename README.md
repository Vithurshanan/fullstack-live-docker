# Fullstack Live Docker Project

Welcome to the **Fullstack Live Docker Project**! This repository demonstrates a full-stack application with a **frontend** built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a **backend** powered by your choice of Node.js, Express, or another backend framework. The entire application is containerized and ready for deployment using **Docker**.

## Features

- Full-stack architecture with a Next.js frontend and a backend API.
- Dockerized for easy deployment and scaling.
- Configured for production-ready standalone builds.
- Supports hot-reloading for development.
- Pre-configured ESLint for consistent code quality.
- TypeScript support for both frontend and backend.

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (React Framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (or any CSS framework used in the project)

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express.js (or your framework)
- TypeScript (optional)

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB (replace with your specific database)

**Other Tools:**
- Docker for containerization
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vithurshanan/fullstack-live-docker.git
    cd fullstack-live-docker
    ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend
    yarn install

    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd ../backend
    yarn install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` files in the `frontend` and `backend` directories to `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` files with your configuration (e.g., database URL, API keys).

## Docker Deployment

This project is fully containerized and can be deployed using Docker.

### Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. Build and start the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Stopping the Containers

Stop the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Environment Variables

The `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend` directories should include the following (example):

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`):
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend (`backend/.env`):
```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

Replace these values with your actual configurations.
